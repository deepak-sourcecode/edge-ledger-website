          Economic lessons from the pandemic
        </h2>

        <p class="description">
          With the complete reopening of the economy in sight, what Europe needs
          to emerge stronger from the pandemic will change. We will have to
          shift from offsetting lost income to adding new income, and from
          preserving productive capacity to reallocating capital and labour
          towards sectors with more favourable opportunities. Whether we will
          succeed depends on how we reform the way in which the European economy
          is governed. When the pandemic hit, the European Union intervened to
          provide immediate support: Fiscal and state aid rules were suspended
          and powerful common instruments were introduced; the European Central
          Bank (ECB) adopted extraordinary actions to help the economy absorb
          the shock and loosened bank capital rules.
        </p>
        <p class="description">
          As the acute phase of the pandemic draws to a close, we are faced with
          a fundamental choice: Do we go back to the pre-crisis model of
          economic policymaking or do we opt to transform it? During the
          financial crisis, the eurozone adopted a wrong policy mix, causing an
          economic gap to emerge with other major economies, one from which we
          have not yet recovered. Back then, the governance of Economic and
          Monetary Union (EMU) revolved around a dichotomy between a lack of
          coordination between fiscal and economic policies — outside of
          emergencies — and far-reaching policy conditionality when it came to
          financial assistance programs. These aid policies were conceived in
          partial equilibrium at the level of single countries; there was too
          little attempt to understand what they meant for the eurozone as a
          whole. This system experienced policy failures and political backlash.
          Limited coordination led to a premature withdrawal of fiscal support
          and sluggish structural reforms, which, in turn, contributed to the
          eurozone’s second recession. Far-reaching conditionality unnecessarily
          divided Europe into creditor and debtor countries, resulting in a deep
          economic and political divide. During the pandemic, however, Europe
          embraced a new model for managing crises. The virus and the
          restrictions put in place to contain it caused not only a huge
          negative demand shock but also a powerful and potentially long-lasting
          adverse supply shock. It accelerated digitalization and automation in
          ways that will radically transform production and the labor market.
        </p>
        <p class="description">
          In the face of these shocks, three paradigm shifts have taken place.
          First, the new European common fiscal instruments, which were
          introduced to ensure broad-based and faster recoveries, were designed
          explicitly in recognition that the EU is more than the sum of its
          parts. Being funded collectively, the Next Generation EU (NGEU)
          package has created a critical fiscal policy space akin to federal
          budget support in other economies. ECB research suggests that if the
          entire NGEU loan envelope were taken up, the program could raise the
          public investment-to-GDP ratio in the eurozone by almost 40 percent by
          2024. The ratio could even double in some countries. The second shift
          is the recognition that reforms are more likely to emerge in a growing
          economy, where resources can be redistributed more easily. That has
          also highlighted the need to align demand- and supply-side policies at
          the EU level. Europe’s sovereign debt crisis illustrated that
          austerity does not pay, and simply stimulating demand would not be
          sufficient to escape the low growth trap. The economy must adapt to
          the new economic environment created by the pandemic, with resources
          being reallocated across sectors and firms.

          Make the Most of Employer Incentives For the slow-and-steady way to
          get rich, take full advantage of your company’s 401(k). You can
          contribute up to $18,000 ($24,000 for people 50 and older) in 2017 to
          this pretax account; your employer may kick in another 4% to 6% of
          your pay, or even more. Many companies enroll employees automatically,
          at a contribution rate of, say, 3% of their salary. But aim for 15% of
          your income, including the company match, from the beginning of your
          career until the end. If you have to cut back for a few years -- say,
          to buy a house or pay college bills -- try to kick in at least enough
          to get the full company match, and boost your contributions later to
          get back on track. Teachers typically have access to 403(b) plans,
          which carry the same terms and benefits as 401(k)s but generally lack
          the breadth of investment options. Public-sector workers may be
          offered a 457 plan, which is also similar to a 401(k) plan but has a
          higher contribution limit for people within three years of normal
          retirement age, usually defined as the age when they can collect
          unreduced pension benefits.

          The most productive companies need to expand, and the unprofitable
          ones need to exit. NGEU recognizes this by providing grants to
          accelerate the green and digital transitions, in exchange for
          growth-enhancing recovery plans that modernize legal and institutional
          frameworks, enabling this reallocation of resources. This points to
          the third paradigm shift, which is more institutional in nature: The
          explicit commitment by EU countries to transform their economies using
          European funding, so that the investment eventually repays itself
          through higher productivity growth and positive demand spillovers.
          This reflects the growing awareness of how interdependent European
          economies are. For example, the European Commission estimates that
          countries like Belgium, Luxembourg, Austria and even Germany will
          obtain most of the GDP stimulus from NGEU through the boost in
          foreign-induced demand, stemming from other corners of the EU. This
          autumn, as Europe reviews its economic governance, we have the
          possibility of taking decisions that will put the recovery and the
          post-crisis economy on stronger footing by building on these three
          paradigm shifts. But this will require a new approach. First, we need
          to make sure this new “European social contract” embodied by NGEU is
          adopted through recovery and resilience plans that are ambitious and
          well implemented. The recovery fund is based on a joint effort —
          through a balance of responsibilities — by European and national
          authorities. It puts European money on the table, while member
          countries put forward concrete plans, which are consistent with EU
          priorities, to tackle their economic and institutional weaknesses. If
          successfully implemented, NGEU will help legitimize this new model,
          and the use of EU bonds, should a future crisis again threaten to
          overwhelm national policies. Second, while NGEU grants will play a
          crucial role in managing the structural transformation created by the
          accelerated shift toward digitalization and automation, the EU
          liquidity toolbox remains insufficiently used or ill-suited to tackle
          this challenge head-on. Loans under NGEU can be used to modernize the
          economy, but the available envelope remains partly untapped.
          Meanwhile, liquidity support provided by programs such as the
          temporary Support to mitigate Unemployment Risks in an Emergency
          (SURE) and the European Stability Mechanism remains targeted at
          yesterday’s challenges — notably, substituting lost income and
          supporting health expenditure, which were more pressing during the
          immediate public health crisis that we are now starting to emerge
          from.

          These tools could be extended and adapted to support various policy
          objectives in the recovery phase, first and foremost boosting human
          capital through measures such as on-the-job training and active labor
          market policies. This would, in turn, stimulate employment growth as
          the recovery picks up speed. Third, it’s important to note that the
          bulk of Europe’s fiscal firepower remains nested in national policies.
          Therefore, reforms to the rules that govern them are essential. Fiscal
          rules aim to guide governments on which policy trajectories are
          consistent with the sustainability of public finances. But because
          they affect demand directly and through expectations, they can only be
          stabilizing if they are countercyclical. A targeted reform should
          therefore include both a conjunctural component (ensuring that fiscal
          policy is responsive to short-run market fluctuations and enables a
          strong recovery) and a structural component (strengthening the
          sustainability of debt over the economic cycle). Only by protecting
          public investment over the entire business cycle, while successfully
          implementing structural reforms, can we boost productivity and growth
          potential and, ultimately, rebuild tax bases and service debt in the
          long run. If we apply the lessons of the pandemic to our economic
          policy, we can emerge from this crisis with a stronger economy and
          greater social and political cohesion. Upgrading the rules by which
          the EMU is governed is unequivocally in the interest of all EU member
          countries, and the importance of NGEU cannot be overstated. Its
          success would recast the EU economic toolbox and shore up the European
          project for generations to come.
