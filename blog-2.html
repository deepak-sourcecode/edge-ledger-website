        <h2 class="heading-3 heading-thin">Shorten the length of your loan.</h2>

        <p class="description">
          Debt commonly refers to a sum of money you owe to someone be it a
          bank, a moneylender, or a friend/relative of you. Debt has become an
          integral part of most of our lives. This is because at some or other
          phases of our life we borrow money to meet our different requirements.
          According to research, approximately 70 % of our population lives with
          debt, it may be a home loan, a personal loan, car loan or owing money
          through credit card. One of the reasons behind this is the wide
          availability of loans these days and hence people find it easier to
          borrow money to fulfil their requirements.
        </p>
        <p class="description">
          Debts help us to get high education, purchase property, meet medical
          emergencies or start our own business. Though debts are considered
          bad, when managed properly it can bring a huge difference in once
          finances. When managed well they can even become the stepping stone of
          one’s life. As debts help us to achieve our goals in the easiest way
          ever. When a debt is managed well it makes our life much easier.
          However, if not managed well, it will come back haunting us.
        </p>
        <p class="description">
          The general perception of debt is that they are just another name of
          evil. But if you change your outlook on credits, the other side of it
          will come to notice. Debts can be considered beneficial with debt
          management strategies and disciplined repayments. Once you miss a
          payment, the situations will change in an instant. You will start
          getting reminder messages, mails, calls from the bank, and in the
          worst cases, the collection agents will start visiting you. It is not
          only restricted here, late payment and default are also mentioned in
          your credit history which further reduces your future
          creditworthiness. However, being in debt is not a big deal for anyone
          who has a regular cash flow. But being unable to manage the same is
          something that can become a stumbling block and hinder our progress.

          Looking back at all the responses can seem overwhelming, but I’m
          seeing a few common themes here: You’ve gotta get a handle on where
          your money is actually going. This makes sense. Without doing so,
          you’re only wandering through the dark and hoping for the best. A
          system like Personal Capital which automatically tracks your income
          and expenses (for free!) can be a godsend here. Find something to
          motivate you. Whether it’s a desire to be free, or fear of paying too
          much in interest; find your motivation and remind yourself of it
          constantly as you continue this journey. Cutting your expenses is the
          low hanging fruit. It’s the obvious step and for good reason; tackling
          your expenses is critical to getting the most out of your dollars.
          Raising your income is a little more difficult, but doing so
          supercharges the repayment process. As all these efforts weave
          together, hold fast. Avoid lifestyle inflation and remember your
          priorities. Above all, stick to it! All of these authors are able to
          write about their progress because they kept going! A payment here and
          there may not seem like much, right until you look back on the
          smoldering crater that used to be a giant mountain of debt. Enjoy the
          freedom! As always, those with student loans may want to check into
          SoFi. SoFi’s average student loan refinancer saves over $17,000 in
          interest payments by refinancing. At the very least, take 3 minutes
          and compare your options are using LendEdu’s free interest rate
          comparison.
