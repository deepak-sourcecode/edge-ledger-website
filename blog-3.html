          Time tested tactics to build your wealth
        </h2>

        <p class="description">
          We have doled out a lot of good advice over the 70 years we’ve been
          publishing Kiplinger's Personal Finance magazine. So in many ways it
          was easy to come up with 70 ideas on how to create wealth. But when
          our editorial staff submitted nearly 300 ideas, the editors had to
          roll up our collective sleeves and distill the advice into absolute
          gems. In this slide show, we offer advice on how to build, protect and
          enhance your wealth, time-tested strategies to help you keep your eye
          on the ball, and our top tips for finding value, so your hard-won
          wealth doesn’t leak out in dribs and drabs. We devote a section to the
          biggest goal of all -- a secure retirement. And because life isn’t all
          about making money, we include fulfilling ways to give back. Take a
          look.

          Save Early and Often The sooner you start to save, the easier it will
          be to amass a comfortable nest egg -- thanks to the power of time and
          the magic of compounding. A 25-year-old who saves $450 a month in a
          tax-deferred retirement account and earns an average yearly return of
          7% will have about $1.1 million by age 65. If the same investor waits
          until age 35 to start saving, she’d have to sock away $950 a month to
          reach roughly the same balance by age 65. Try to save 15% of your
          income, including any employer match for your retirement plan. If
          that’s not doable, put away as much as you can and increase the
          percentage as your income and budget allow. “Getting started, even if
          you’re saving 3% of your income or $10 a week, is the critical goal,”
          says Molly Balunek, a certified financial planner in Cleveland. “Once
          you see progress, it becomes easier to save 1% more, or $5 more a
          week.”

          Create an Emergency Fund If you have a dedicated stash of cash at the
          ready in case of a job loss or an unexpected bill -- say, for a major
          car repair or hospital visit -- you won’t have to resort to racking up
          credit card debt or, say, tapping retirement savings to cover the tab.
          Squirrel away at least three to six months’ worth of living expenses
          in a safe, easy-to-access savings or money market deposit account.
          (For a more personalized amount to save, use HelloWallet.com’s tool.)
          Look for an account with no monthly fee, a low (or no) minimum balance
          requirement and a competitive rate, such as the Synchrony Bank High
          Yield Savings and the GS Bank Online Savings accounts. Both recently
          yielded 1.05%.

          Make the Most of Employer Incentives For the slow-and-steady way to
          get rich, take full advantage of your company’s 401(k). You can
          contribute up to $18,000 ($24,000 for people 50 and older) in 2017 to
          this pretax account; your employer may kick in another 4% to 6% of
          your pay, or even more. Many companies enroll employees automatically,
          at a contribution rate of, say, 3% of their salary. But aim for 15% of
          your income, including the company match, from the beginning of your
          career until the end. If you have to cut back for a few years -- say,
          to buy a house or pay college bills -- try to kick in at least enough
          to get the full company match, and boost your contributions later to
          get back on track. Teachers typically have access to 403(b) plans,
          which carry the same terms and benefits as 401(k)s but generally lack
          the breadth of investment options. Public-sector workers may be
          offered a 457 plan, which is also similar to a 401(k) plan but has a
          higher contribution limit for people within three years of normal
          retirement age, usually defined as the age when they can collect
          unreduced pension benefits.

          Open a Roth Another surefire wealth builder is a Roth IRA. You fund
          this account with after-tax dollars, so the pain is up front. The
          payoff? Withdrawals are tax-free if you’re at least 59½ and have held
          the account for at least five years (you can always withdraw your
          contributions tax- and penalty-free). You don’t have to take required
          minimum distributions from a Roth, as you do with traditional IRAs and
          401(k)s, allowing you to withdraw the money strategically or let it
          grow and leave it to your heirs. And because withdrawals from a Roth
          aren’t reported to the IRS as income, they won’t increase the taxes on
          your Social Security benefits or trigger the high-income surcharge on
          Medicare Part B or Part D. You can contribute up to $5,500 a year to a
          Roth ($6,500 if you’re 50 or older) in 2017. The allowed contribution
          starts to shrink if your modified adjusted gross income is more than
          $118,000 ($186,000 for married couples filing jointly) and disappears
          altogether at $133,000 ($196,000 for joint filers). Earn too much to
          qualify for a Roth? Your employer may offer a Roth 401(k), which has
          no income limits and carries the same contribution cap as a regular
          401(k). Roths aren’t just for grown-ups. One of the best ways to help
          your children or grandchildren build wealth is to get them started
          early with a Roth IRA. Children of any age who have earned income from
          a job can contribute up to $5,500 to a Roth IRA (or their earnings for
          the year, if less), and you can give them the money to get started.
          Not all brokerages let children open Roths, but several -- including
          Fidelity, Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade -- offer custodial Roths
          with little or no investing minimum and no IRA maintenance fees.

          10 Timeless Tips From Knight Kiplinger Some lessons from our 70 years
          of giving readers practical advice on how to save, manage, invest and
          spend their money. Wealth creation isn’t a matter of what you earn.
          It’s how much of it you save. Your biggest barrier to becoming rich is
          living like you’re rich before you are. Pay yourself first. Arrange to
          have your retirement and other savings deducted from your paycheck
          before the money hits your bank account. If there isn’t enough left
          over for your bills, cut your spending. No one ever got into trouble
          by borrowing too little. Conspicuous consumption will make you
          inconspicuously poor. The key to stock market success isn’t your
          timing of the market. It’s your time in the market—the longer, the
          better. Diversify, because every asset has its day in the sun—and its
          day in the doghouse. Keep a cool head when others are losing theirs.
          When others are selling investments, it’s usually a good time to buy.
          The foundations of great fortunes are laid in bear markets, not bull
          markets. Money can’t buy happiness, but it can make unhappiness easier
          to bear. Sharing your wealth with others is more fun than spending it
          on yourself.
